# ts-monorepo

This repository showcases a issue I have with the watch task of nestjs.

If I use the nestjs branch of this project and edit the list in the "Service" (index.ts) in module1 the nestjs will not recompile and restart.
But in the main branch where I have a typescript only approach it works as expected.

#### How to use

```bash
npm i
```

```bash
npm run dev
```
